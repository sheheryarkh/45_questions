// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// This program stores a favorite number in a variable, creates a message to reveal the favorite number, and prints that message.

// Store favorite number in a variable

import co from "co"

const favorite_Number: number =7;

// Create a message to reveal the favorite number
const message_: string = `favorite number is ${favorite_Number}.`;

// Print the message
console.log(message_);
