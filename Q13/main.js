//Q20:- Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
// Create an array of mountains
var countries = ["pakistan", "china", "usa", "france", "turkey"];
// Print the array of mountains
console.log("List of mountains:", countries);
for (var _i = 0, countries_1 = countries; _i < countries_1.length; _i++) {
    var top_1 = countries_1[_i];
    console.log(top_1);
}
